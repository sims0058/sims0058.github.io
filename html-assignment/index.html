                    I am a graphic designer. I am also a researcher who is curious about everything about design and has a passion for design.
                    After graduating from college, I worked for a publisher for about 3 years and designed children's books. 
                    <em> I made illustrations for children's books.</em> I have worked as a graphic designer in the <em>worker union</em> for the last 4 years. 
                    This experience has given me many other skills. Now, I am different from 4 years ago both as a person and as a profession. 
                    <p></p>
                    I am currently working freelance from time to time. I am also a full time student at Interactive Media at Algonquin College.
                    It's exciting to be a student again after about 10 years. I have a great opportunity to learn new things and improve myself in interactive media, video, web design and more.
                    Besides all this, I am also the mother of a little boy. He turned 4 years old on the 3<sup>rd</sup> of May. If I can find time for all this, I like to read books, walk, watch movies, but more often spend time with my son and play games.
